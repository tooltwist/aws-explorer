The files in this directory provide the configuration for
application {{{APPLICATION}}} in environment {{{ENVIRONMENT}}}.

The SETENV file provides a single location for configuration variables.

In the current implementation, the Volumes and Scripts directories get
mounted into the running Docker containers via a rather convoluted path.

  Here -> secure CodeCommit repo
    -> Downloaded in CodePipeline 'Source' Stage
    -> Merged with source code in CodePipeline 'Merge' Stage
    -> Config installed to /SecureConfig in Docker container during CodePipeline 'Build' Stage
    -> Deploy.zip extracted in CodePipeline 'Extract' stage
    -> Deploy.zip provides template used by CloudFormation in CodePipeline 'Deploy' stage

In that final stage, the Docker image is deployed as a service into ECS.

Deploy/service.cf is a Cloudformation script to configure the application
as an ECS service. For repeat builds, the same definition is rerun to update
the service to use the new Docker image.
