build-on-docker
start-on-docker
Config

	These scripts allow you to test building your application inside a Docker container
	running on the local machine.

	These are unlikely to have full functionality - the objective is to make sure the
	Docker build is running properly, before we try to build on Amazon CodePipeline,
	where it is difficult to debug.
